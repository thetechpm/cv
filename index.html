            <p>Growing up, I always found myself leading group projects and being the connector between friend groups. As a program manager for Microsoft, I professionalize those skills by connecting with our UX designers, software developers, and customers to build a world-class control plane for the Azure cloud platform and by representing my products at conferences around the world.</p>
            <p>I am a highly creative, results-oriented technology professional, who believes in the value of leadership within the engineering industry. In my own time, I work to encourage women and minorities to stay within the engineering discipline through my efforts previously with the Intel sponsored Stay With It Squad and as Chair of the IEEE Seattle Section Women in Engineering (WIE) chapter and through my position as a lead in the Squad that supports early-in-career employees with Microsoft's Azure Core organization.</p>
